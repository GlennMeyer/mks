    	<h1>Hipsters</h1>
    	<p class="author">By Harsh Patel</p>
    	<h2>Overview</h2>
    	<p>The hipster <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture">subculture</a> typically consists of white millennials living in urban areas.[1][2] The subculture has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior"[3] and is broadly associated with indie and alternative music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility (including vintage and thrift store-bought clothes), generally progressive political views, organic and artisanal foods, and alternative lifestyles.[4][5][6] Hipsters are typically described as affluent or middle class young Bohemians who reside in gentrifying neighborhoods.</p>
    	<h2>What the Heck is a Hipster?</h2>
    	<p>The term in its current usage first appeared in the 1990s and became particularly prominent in the 2010s,[9] being derived from the term used to describe earlier movements in the 1940s.[10] Members of the subculture do not self-identify as hipsters, and the word hipster is often used as a pejorative to describe someone who is pretentious,[11] overly trendy or effete.[7][12] Some analysts contend that the notion of the contemporary hipster is actually a myth created by marketing.</p>
